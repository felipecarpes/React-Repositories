# React-Repositories

## In this application we use some concepts learned during Rocketseat Bootcamp, we consume the GitHub API itself. Where we can list repositories that are stored in LocalStorage, we can also view all issues, or even filter them as open or closed.

### Tools used:

- react-router-dom
- react-icons
- axes
- styled components
- prop-types
- eslint
- prettier
- editorConfig
